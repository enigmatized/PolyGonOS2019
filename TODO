Most of the asm is boilerplate code
Some of the c code I wrote
Some of it I got sick of not getting anything working.
Some of it is copied.
I usually left the source of where I took code from.
//Looking back on this, Looks like I did a crappy job
//I will go back and do a better job because that is super helpful

A lot of things are left undone.
I usually wanted to get the most basic version of something working
Then I sorta moved on.

You can see where I didn't finish something(like empty functions...)


TODO:
Everything.
Litereally everything that is here has some major flaws, is unfinished, or hanging on by a thread.
